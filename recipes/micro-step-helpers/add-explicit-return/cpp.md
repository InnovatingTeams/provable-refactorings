# Add Explicit Return

You have a function you would like to add a return at the end of:

```cpp
void Foo(){
  //some code
}

```

Becomes:

```cpp
void Foo(){
  //some code
  return;
}
```

Notes: this pairs well with [move line into all if/else branches]()

# Recipe

## 1. Add Return after the method

Find the end of the method and add copy/paste the following afterwards:

```cpp
return;
```

The code should now look like:

```cpp
void Foo(){
  //some code
}
return;
```

**Proof:** The code should **not** compile after this stage

## 2. Move the line up 1 line

Move the line up one line (most editors have a keyboard shortcut for this).

The code should now look like:

```cpp
void Foo(){
  //some code
  return;
}
```

**Proof:** The code should now **compile**
