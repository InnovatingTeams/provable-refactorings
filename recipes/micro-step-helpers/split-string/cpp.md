# Split String

You a string literal that you want to split into 2 string literals.

```cpp
"This string has 2 parts"
```

Becomes:

```cpp
"This string has "+"2 parts"
```

# Recipe

## 1. Add std::string() to beginning if needed

Copy/paste the following before the string:

```cpp
std::string() +
```

The code should now look like:

```cpp
std::string() + "This string has 2 parts"
```

Notes: this step might not be needed if you are already have a std::string object being concatenated to the string already.
You can test this by skipping this step.

**Proof:** The code should **compile**

Notes: the only other way the code will compile after pasting this is if you paste into a comment or between an existing string:

```cpp
"std::string() + sometext";
```

## 2. Add Separator

Now copy/paste the following into the middle of the string where you want to split it:

```cpp
"+"
```

**Proof:** The code should  **compile**
